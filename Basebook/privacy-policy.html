            <p>
                We are committed to protecting the privacy and security of our
                users' personal data. This privacy policy explains how we handle
                user data in the Basebook app.
            </p>

            <h2>What Information Do We Collect?</h2>

            <p>
                We do not collect any personal information from you. All data
                entered into the app, including conversion operations, is stored
                locally on your device using SwiftData and synced with your
                iCloud account using iCloudKit. This means that all data remains
                under your control and is not transmitted to our servers or any
                third-party services.
            </p>

            <h2>How Do We Use Your Information?</h2>

            <p>
                Since we do not collect any personal information, we do not use
                your information for any purpose. The app operates solely on the
                data you enter and store locally on your device.
            </p>

            <h2>How Do We Protect Your Information?</h2>

            <p>
                As we do not collect or store any personal information, we do
                not have any measures in place to protect it. However, we
                recommend that you follow best practices to secure your device
                and iCloud account to protect your data.
            </p>

            <h2>Sharing Your Information</h2>

            <p>
                We do not share your information with third parties, as we do
                not collect any personal information.
            </p>

            <h2>Your Rights</h2>

            <p>
                Since we do not collect any personal information, you do not
                have any rights related to accessing, updating, or deleting your
                information. However, you can manage your data within the app
                and iCloud account at any time.
            </p>

            <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>

            <p>
                We may update this policy from time to time. If we make
                significant changes, we will notify you through the app or by
                email.
            </p>
